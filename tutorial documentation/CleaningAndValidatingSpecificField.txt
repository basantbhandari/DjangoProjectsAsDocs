Cleaning and Validating Specific Field
==========================================
    clean_<fieldname>() - This method is called on a form subclass where <fieldname> is 
        replaced with the name of the form field attribute.

    This method does any cleaning that is specific to that particular attribute, unrelated 
        to the type of field that it is.
    
    This method is not passed any parameters.

    You will need to look up the field in self.cleaned_data and remember that it will be a 
        Python object at this point, not the original string submitted in the form.


    Example:
    =========
    forms.py 
    ========
        from django import forms
        class StudentRegistration(forms.Form):
            name = forms.CharField()
            email = forms.EmailField()
            password = forms.CharField(widget= forms.PasswordInput)
            def clean_name(self):
                valname = self.cleaned_data['name']   //   valname = self.cleaned_data.get('name')
                if len(valname) < 4:
                    raise forms.ValidationError('Enter more than or equal 4')


                return valname
