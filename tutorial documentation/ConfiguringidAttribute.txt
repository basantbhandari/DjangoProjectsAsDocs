Configure id attribute
===========================
    auto_id : The id attribute values are generated by prepending id_ to the form field names. This behaviour
    is configurable, through, if you want to change the id convention or remove HTML id attributes and
    <label> tags entirely.



    Use the auto_id argument to the Form constructor to control the id and label behaviour. This argument
    must be True, False or a string. By default, auto_id is set to the string 'id_%s'.

    Example:
        fm = StudentRegistration(auto_id=False)
        fm = StudentRegistration(auto_id='geeky')

        If auto_id is set to a string containing the format character '%s', then the form output will include
            <label> tags, and will generate id attributes based on the format string.

        If auto_id is set to True, then the form output will include <label> tags nor id attributes.
        If auto_id is det to any other true value - such as a string that doesn't include %s - then the library will 
            act as if auto_id is True.

=========================
Configure label tags
=========================
label_suffix -  A translateble string (default to a colon (:) in English ) that will be appended after any label name when a form is rendered.

                It is possible to customize that character, or omit it entirely, using the label_suffix parameter.

                The label suffix is added only if the last character of the label isn't a punctuation character (in English, 
                    those are ., !, ? or :)

                fm = StudentRegistration(label_suffix='')



========================
Dynamic initial value
========================
    initial-initial is used to declare the initial value of form field at runtime.

    To accomplish this, use the initial argument to a Form. This argument, if given, should be a dictionary
    mapping field names to initial values. Only include the fields for which you are specifying an initial value;
    it is not necessary to include every field in your form.

    If a Field defines initial and you include initial when instantiating the Form, then the letter initial will have precedence.
