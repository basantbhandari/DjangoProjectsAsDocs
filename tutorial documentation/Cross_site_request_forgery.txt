what is Cross Site Request Forgery (SCRF/XSRF)
================================================
    A Cross-site request forgery hole is when a malicious site can cause a visitor's browser to make a request
    to your server that causes a change on the server. The server thinks that because the request comes with 
    the user's cookies, the user wanted to submit that form.
