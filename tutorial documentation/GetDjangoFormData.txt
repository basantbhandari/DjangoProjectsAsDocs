Django Form and Field Validation
=========================================
    is_valid() : This method is used to run validation and return a Boolean designating whether the data was 
        valid as True or not as False. This returns True ar False

        Syntax: Form.is_valid()


    cleaned_data : This attribute is used to access clean data. Each field in a Form class is responsible not only for 
        validating data, but also for cleaning it normalizing it to a consistent format. This is a nice feature, because it 
        allows data for a particular field to be input in a variety of ways, always resulting in consistent output. Once you 
        have created a Form instance with a set of data and validated it, you can access the clean data via its cleaned_data 
        attribute.

    Any text based field such as CharField or EmailField always cleans the input into a string.

    If your data does not validate, the cleaned_data dictionary contains only the valid fields.

    cleaned_data will always only contains a key for fields defined in the Form, even if you pass extra data when you 
        define the Form.
    
    When the Form is valid, cleaned_data will include a key and value for all its fields, even if the data didn't include a 
    value for some optional fields.
