Include Tag
================
{% Include %} Tag : It loads a templates and renders it with the current context. This is a way of "including"
other templates within a template. Each include is a completely independent rendering process.

The template name can either be a variable or a habd-coded (quoted) string, in either single or double quotes.

Syntex:
    {% include temp_var_name %}
    {% include "template_name.html" %}
    {% include "folder/template_name.html" %}

Example:
    {% include topvar %}
    {% include "topcourse.html" %}
    {% include "fees/topcourse.html" %}

We can pass additional context explicitly to the template using with keyword.
    {% include "topcourse.html" with p="PHP" d="Django" %}

If we want to render the context only with the variables provided (or even no
variables at all ), use the only option. No other variables are available to the included
template.

    {% include "topcourse.html" with p="PHP" only %}
