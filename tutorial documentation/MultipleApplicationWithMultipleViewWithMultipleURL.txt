How to install Application in our Project
==========================================
    As we know a project can contain Multiple Application so 
    just creating application inside a project is not enough 
    we also have to install application in our project.
    
    We install application in our project using setting.py file.
    
    setting.py file is available at Project Level which means 
    we can install all the application of project.

    This is compulsory otherwise Application won't be recognized by Django.

    Open setting.py file

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'application_name_1',
        'application_name_2',
    ]
    Save setting.py File 


    example:
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'course',
    ]
    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'course',
        'fees',
    ]


Function Based Views
============================

views.py of course
==================
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    def learn_django(request):
        return HttpResponse('Hello Django')

views.py of fees
==================
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    def fee_django(request):
        return HttpResponse('300')


URL Pattern
=================
    urls.py
    ==========
    from course import views as cv
    from fees import views as fv

    urlpatterns = [
        path('learndj/', cv.learn_django),
        path('feedj/', fv.fee_django),
    ]

    another way:
    urls.py
    ========
    from course.views import learn_django
    from fees.views import fee_django

    urlpatterns = [
        path('learndj/', learn_django),
        path('feesdj/', fee_django),
    ]
