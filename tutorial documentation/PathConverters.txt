Path Convertors
================
    str - Matches any non-empty string, excluding the path seperator, '/'. This is the default if a Convertor isn't included in the expression.

    int - Matches zero or any positive integer. Return an int.

    slug - Matches any slug string cinsisting of ASCII letters or numbers, plus the hyphen and underscore characters. For example, building-your-1st-django-site.

    uuid - Matches a formatted UUID. To prevent multiple URLs from mapping to the same page, dashes
        must be included and letters must be lowercase. For example, 075194d3-6885-417e-a8a8-dkdk3nk3n4n447. Returns a UUID instance.

    path - Matches any non-empty string, including the path seperator, '/'. This allows you to match against a complete URL path rather than a segment of a URL path as with str.

Create a Path Convertor Class
=============================
    Convertors.py
    =============
        class FourDigitYearConvertor:
            regex = '[0-9]{4}'
            def to_python(self, value):
                return int(value)
            def to_url(self, value):
                return '%04d'% value



        where, 
        regex is an attribute, as a string.
        
        to_python(self, value) method, which handles converting the matched string into the type that should be
        passed to the view function. It should raise ValueError if it can't convert the given value. A ValueError
        is interpreted as no match and as a consequence a 404 response is sent to the user unless another URL
        pattern matches.

        to_url(self, value) method, which handles converting the Python type into a string to be used in the URL.



======================================
Register Path Converter 
======================================
    urls.py
    ========
        from django.urls import path, register_converter
        from . import Converters, views

        register_converter(converters.FourDigitYearConvertor, 'yyyy')
        urlpatterns = [
            path('session/<yyyy: year>', views.show_details, name="detail")
        ]
