=========================================
The per-view cache
=========================================
    A more granular way to use the caching framework is by caching the output of individual 
    views. django.views.decorators.cache defines a cache_page decorator that will automatically cache the view's 
    response. If multiple URLs point at the same view, each URL will be cached seperately.

    from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page

    @cache_page(timeout, cache, key_prefix)
    def my_view(request):
        pass


    where, 
        timeout : The cache timeout, in seconds.
        cache: This directs the decorator to use a specific cache (from your CACHES setting) when caching view
               results. By default, the default cache will be used.
        
        key_prefix: You can also override the cache prefix on a per-views basis. It works in the same way as the 
        CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX setting for the middleware.


===============================================
    Specifying per-view cache in the URLconf
===============================================
    from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page

    urlpatterns = [
        path('route', cache_page(timeout, cache, key_prefix)(view_function)),
    ]

    urlpatterns = [
        path('home/', cache_page(60)(views.home), name="home"),
    ]




========================================
    Database Caching
========================================
    Django can store it is cached data in your database. This works best if you have got a fast, well-indexed database
    server.

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache',
            'LOCATION': 'my_cache_table',  # table should be different then other table
        }
    }



    Before using the database cache, you must crete the cache table with this command:

    python manage.py createcachetable

    This creates a table in your database that is in the proper format that Django's database-cache system expects.
    The name of the table is taken from LOCATION.

    If you are using multiple database cache, createcachetable creates one table for each cache.



========================================
    Cache Arguments
========================================
    Each cache backend can be given additional arguments to control caching behavior.

    TIMEOUT : The default timeout, in seconds, to use for the cache. This argument defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes). You 
    can set TIMEOUT to None so that, by defaults to 300 seconds(5 minutes). You can 
    set TIMEOUT to None so that, by default, cache keys never expire. A value of 0 causes keys to immediately expire 
    (effectively "don't cache").

    OPTIONS : Any options that should be passed to the backend. The list of valid options will very with each backend, and 
    cache backends backed by a third-party library will pass their options directly to the underlying cache library.


    Cache backends that implement their own culling strategy (i.e., the locmem, filesystem and database backends) will honor the
    following options:

    MAX_ENTRIES : The maximum number of entries allowed in the cache before ald values are deleted. This argument defaults
    to 300.

    CULL_FREQUENCY : The fraction of entries that are culled when MAX_ENTRIES is reached. The actual ratio is 1 /
    CULL_FREQUENCY, so set CULL_FREQUENCY to 2 to cull half the entries when MAX_ENTRIES is reached. This 
    argument should be an integer and defaults to 3.

    A value of 0 for CULL_FREQUENCY means that the entire cache will be dumped when MAX_ENTRIES is reached. On 
    some backends(database in particular) this makes culling much faster at the expense of more cache misses.




    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache',
            'LOCATION': 'my_cache_table',  # table should be different then other table
            'TIMEOUT': 60,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'MAX_ENTRIES': 1000
            }
       
        }
    }

===================================================
    Filesystem Caching
===================================================
    The file-based backend serializes and stores each cache value as a seperate file.


    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache',
            'LOCATION': 'c:/Django code/p72',  # table should be different then other table
        }
    }


    Make sure the directory pointed-to by this setting exists and is readable and writable by the system user under 
    which your Web server runs.



    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache',
            'LOCATION': '/var/tmp/django_code',  # table should be different then other table
        }
    }

===================================================
    Local Memory Caching
===================================================
    This is the default cache if another is not specified in your settings file. This cache is per-process and thread-safe.

    Each process will have its own private cache instance, which means no cross-process caching is possibl. This 
    obviously also means the local memory cache isn't particularly memory-efficient.

    It's probably not a good choice for production environments. It is nice for development.


    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
            'LOCATION': 'unique-snowflake', 
        }
    }
