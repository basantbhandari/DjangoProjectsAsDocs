Permissions and Authorization
==============================
    Django comes with a built-in permissions system. It provides a way to assign permissions to specify
    users and groups of users.

    The Django admin site uses permissions as follows:
        Access to view objects is limited to users with the "view" or "change" permission for that type of
        object.

        Access to the "add" form and add an object is limited to users with the "add" permission for 
        that type of object.

        Access to view the change list, view the "change" form and change an object is limited to users
        with the "change" permission for that type of object.

        Access to delete an object is limited to users with the "delete" permission for that type of object.


===================
    myuser.groups.set([group_list])
    myuser.groups.add(group, group, ...)
    myuser.groups.remove(group, group, ...)
    myuser.groups.clear()
    myuser.user_permissions.set([permission_list])
    myuser.user_permissions.add(permission, permission, ...)
    myuser.user_permissions.remove(permission, permission, ...)
    myuser.user_permissions.clear()
    
        

    When a model is created, Django will automatically create four default permissions for the following 
    actions:

    add : Users with this permission can add an instance of the model.
    delete : Users with this permission can delete an instance of the model.
    change : Users with this permission can change an instance of the model.
    view : Users with this permission can view an instance of the model.


    Permission names follow a very specify naming convension: appname.action_modelname
    Example: enroll.delete_blog


    The currently logged-in user's permissions are stored in the template variable {{ perms }}. This is an
    instance of django.contrib.auth.context_processors.PermWrapper, which is a template-friendly proxy
    pf permissions.

    Example:
    {% if perms.enroll.delete_blog %}
        <input type="button" value="Delete" >
        <br>
    {% endif %}

    {% if perms.enroll %}
        <input type="button" value="Delete" >
        <br>
    {% endif %}

    Refers to the project p60 in django code

    superuser
    username = basant
    password = basant2074


    ================
    user
    ====
    username = Ramesh
    password = 3aENqpip9Evo


    username = sonam
    password = BpZT1DN2YD7Q


    username = Harish
    password = 8Fy9a6FRMnyp
