How to Register Model 
=======================
    We are registering our table which we has created using model class, to default admin interface.

    To Register Follow:
        Open admin.py file which is inside Application Folder
        Import your own Model Class created inside Application's models.py
        admin.site.register(ModelClassName)


    Example:
        Open admin.py
        from enroll.models import Student
        admin.site.register(Student)



=========================
__str__() Method
=================
    The __str__() method is called whenever you call str() on an object.
    To display an object in the Django admin site and as the value inserted into a template when 
    it displays an object. Thus, you should always return a nice, human-readable representation of the model from the __str__() method.

    Write this Method in your own model class which is include models.py file.

    Syntax:
        def __str__(self):
        return self.fieldName

    Example:
        def __str__(self):
            return self.stuname
