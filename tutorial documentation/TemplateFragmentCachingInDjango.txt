==============================
Temmplate Fragment Caching
==============================
    This gives you more control what to cache.
    {% load cache %} - This gives access to cache tag in template.

    {% cache %} - This template tag caches the contents of the block for a given amount of time.

    Syntax :

    {% cache timeout name variable using="" %}.....{% endcache name %}

    Timeout : The cache timeout, in seconds. Thie fragment is cached forever if timeout is None. It can be a template 
    variable, as long as the template variable resolves to an integer value.


    Name : The name to give the cache fragment. The name will be taken as is, do not use a variable.

    variable : This can be a variable with or without filters. This will cache multiple copies of a fragment depending 
    on some dynamic data that appears inside the fragment.

    using : The cache tag will try to use the given cache. If no such cache exists, it will fall back to using the default 
    cache. You may select an alternate cache backend to use with the using keyword argument, which must be the last argument to the tag.


    Example :
        {% load cache %}

        {% cache 60 sidebar request.user.username using="localcache" %}
            ...sidebar for logged in user ..
        {% endcache %}


========================================
    Database Caching
========================================
    Django can store it is cached data in your database. This works best if you have got a fast, well-indexed database
    server.

    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache',
            'LOCATION': 'my_cache_table',  # table should be different then other table
        }
    }

    Before using the database cache, you must crete the cache table with this command:

    python manage.py createcachetable

    This creates a table in your database that is in the proper format that Django's database-cache system expects.
    The name of the table is taken from LOCATION.

    If you are using multiple database cache, createcachetable creates one table for each cache.





========================================
    Cache Arguments
========================================
    Each cache backend can be given additional arguments to control caching behavior.

    TIMEOUT : The default timeout, in seconds, to use for the cache. This argument defaults to 300 seconds (5 minutes). You 
    can set TIMEOUT to None so that, by defaults to 300 seconds(5 minutes). You can 
    set TIMEOUT to None so that, by default, cache keys never expire. A value of 0 causes keys to immediately expire 
    (effectively "don't cache").

    OPTIONS : Any options that should be passed to the backend. The list of valid options will very with each backend, and 
    cache backends backed by a third-party library will pass their options directly to the underlying cache library.


    Cache backends that implement their own culling strategy (i.e., the locmem, filesystem and database backends) will honor the
    following options:

    MAX_ENTRIES : The maximum number of entries allowed in the cache before ald values are deleted. This argument defaults
    to 300.

    CULL_FREQUENCY : The fraction of entries that are culled when MAX_ENTRIES is reached. The actual ratio is 1 /
    CULL_FREQUENCY, so set CULL_FREQUENCY to 2 to cull half the entries when MAX_ENTRIES is reached. This 
    argument should be an integer and defaults to 3.

    A value of 0 for CULL_FREQUENCY means that the entire cache will be dumped when MAX_ENTRIES is reached. On 
    some backends(database in particular) this makes culling much faster at the expense of more cache misses.




    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache',
            'LOCATION': 'my_cache_table',  # table should be different then other table
            'TIMEOUT': 60,
            'OPTIONS': {
                'MAX_ENTRIES': 1000
            }
       
        }
    }

===================================================
    Filesystem Caching
===================================================
    The file-based backend serializes and stores each cache value as a seperate file.


    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache',
            'LOCATION': 'c:/Django code/p72',  # table should be different then other table
        }
    }


    Make sure the directory pointed-to by this setting exists and is readable and writable by the system user under 
    which your Web server runs.



    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache',
            'LOCATION': '/var/tmp/django_code',  # table should be different then other table
        }
    }

===================================================
    Local Memory Caching
===================================================
    This is the default cache if another is not specified in your settings file. This cache is per-process and thread-safe.

    Each process will have its own private cache instance, which means no cross-process caching is possibl. This 
    obviously also means the local memory cache isn't particularly memory-efficient.

    It's probably not a good choice for production environments. It is nice for development.


    CACHES = {
        'default': {
            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',
            'LOCATION': 'unique-snowflake', 
        }
    }
