Why URL Pattern inside Application
=====================================
So far we have learnt to define url pattern at project level for our all application.

This approach increases the dependency of applications in project which means if we 
want to use a particular application for our another project we may face issues.

Our each application should be independent or less depend on project so we could use  our 
applications in different projects easily without worrying about urls.py available in Project
Folder.


Following are the benefits of defining url pattern inside Application
    Reduces the dependency of Application
    Enhance Application performance.
    Reusability of application because easy.


====================
include()
=====================
A function that takes a full python import path to another URLconf model that
should be "included" in this place.

Optionally, the application namespace and instance namespace where the entries will 
be included into can also be specified.

include() also accepts as an argument either an iterable that returns URL patterns 
or a 2-tuple containing such iterable plus the names of the application namespace.

urlpatterns can "include" other URLconf modules.
Syntax:
    include(module, namespace=None)
    include(pattern_list)
    include((pattern_list, app_namespace), namespace=None)

where, 
    module- URLconf module (or module name)
    namespace(str)- Instance namespace for the URL entries being included
    pattern_list- Iterable of path() and/or re_path() instance.
    app_namespace(str)- Application namespace for the URL entries being included.


Syntax:
    include(module, namespace=None)
    include(pattern_list)
    include((pattern_list, app_namespace), namespace=None)

Example:
    from django.urls import include, path
    urlpatterns = [
        path('cor/', include('course.urls')),
    ]
    urlpatterns = [
        path('cor/', include([
            path('learndj/', views.learn_django),
            path('learnpy/', views.learn_python),
        ]))
    ]



====================================
Write URL Pattern inside Application
====================================
    Create an urls.py file inside each application(in case multiple application).
    Write all the url pattern related to application, in urls.py file available inside application.
    Include Application's urls.py file inside Project's urls.py file.

    views.py in Application Folder
        from django.http import HttpResponse
        def learn_django(request):
            return HttpResponse('Hello Django')
        
        def learn_python(request):
            return HttpResponse('<h1>Hello python</h1>')

    urls.py in Application Folder
        from course import views
        urlpatterns = [
            path('learndj/', views.learn_django),
            path('learnpy/', views.learn_python),
        ]

    urls.py in Project Folder
        from django.urls import path, include
        urlpatterns = [
            path('cor/', include('course.urls')),
        ]

     
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/cor/learndj
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/cor/learnpy

Geeky Steps
==================
    Create Django Project: django-admin startproject geekyshows
    Change Directory to Django Project : cd geekyshows
    Create Django Application: python manage.py startapp course
    Add/Install Application to Django Project using settings.py file
        INSTALLED_APP
    Write View Function inside views.py file
    Create an urls.py file inside each application(in case multile application).
    Write all urls.py file inside each application, in urls.py file available inside application.
    Include Application's urls.py file inside Project's urls.py file.
