User Authentication System
============================
    Django comes with a user authentication system. It handles user accounts, groups, permissions and 
    cookie-based user sessions.

    Django authentication provides both authentication and authorization together and is generally
    referred to as the authentication system.


    By default, the required configuration is already included in the settings.py generated by 
    django-admin startproject, these consist of two items listed in your INSTALLED_APPS setting:

    'django.contrib.auth' contains the core of the authentication framework, and its default models.
    'django.contrib.contenttypes' is the Django content type system, which allows permissions to be 
    associated with models you create.

    and these items in your MIDDLEWARE settings:
    SesionMidddleware manages sessions across requests.
    AuthenticationMiddleware associates users with requests using sessions.

    User Object: User Objects are the core of the authentication system.
    
    They typically represent the people interacting with your site and are used to enable things like
    restricting access, registering user profiles, associating content with creators etc.

    Only one class of user exits in Django's authentication framework, i.e..., 'superusers' or admin 'staff'
    users are just user objects with special attributes set, not different classes of user objects.
