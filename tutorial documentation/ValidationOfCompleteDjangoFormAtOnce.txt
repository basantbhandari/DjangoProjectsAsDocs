Validation of Complete Django Form at once
=============================================
    clean() : The clean() method on a Field subclass is responsible for running to_python(), validate(), and
        run_validators() in the correct order and propagating their errors.
    If at any time, any of the methods raise ValidationError, the validation stops and error is raised.
    This method returns the clean data, which is then inserted into the cleaned_data dictionary of the form.
    Implement a clean() method on your Form when you must add custom validation for fields that are interdependent.

    forms.py 
    =========
    from Django import forms
    class StudentRegistration(forms.Form):
        name = forms.CharField()
        email = forms.EmailField()
        def clean(self):
            cleaned_data = super().clean()
            valname = self.cleaned_data['name']
            if len(valname) < 4:
                raise forms.ValidationError('Name should be more than or equal 4')
          
            valemail = self.cleaned_data['email']
            if len(valemail) < 10:
                raise forms.ValidationError('Name should be more than or equal 10')
