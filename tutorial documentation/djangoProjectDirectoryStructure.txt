Django Project Directory Structure
====================================
__init__.py  :  The folder which contains __init__.py file is considered as a python package.
wsgi.py  :  WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) is a specification that describes how a web server communicates with web applications, and how web applications can be chained together to process ane request. WSGI provided a standard for synchronous Python apps.
asgi.py  :  ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) is a spiritual successor to WSGI, intended to provide a standard interface between async-capable Python web servers, frameworks, and applications. ASGI provides standard for both asynchronous and synchronous apps.
settings.py  :  This file contains all the information or data about project settings.
            eg: Database config information, Template, Installed Application, Validators ets.
urls.py  :  This file contains information of url attached with application.
manage.py  :  manage.py is automatically created in each Django project. It is Django's command-line utility also sets the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE environment variable so that it points to your project's settings.py file.
              Generally, when working on a single Django PROJECT, it is easier to use manage.py than django-admin.           



When we run the sever, project structure will look like:
