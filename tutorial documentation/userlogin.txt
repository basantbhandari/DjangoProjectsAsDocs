authenticate()
==================
    authenticate(request=None, **credentials) : This is used to verify a set of credentials. It takes
    credentials as keyword arguments, username and password for the default case, checks them against
    each authentication backend, and returns a User object if the credentials are valid for a backend.

    If the credentials are not valid for any backend or if a backend raises PermissionDenied, it returns None.

    request is an optional HttpRequest which is passed on the authenticate() method of the authentication
    backends.

    Example:
    user = authenticate(username='sonam', password='geekyshows')



====================================
login()
====================================
    login(request, user, backend=None) : To log a user in, from a view, use login(). It takes an
    HttpRequest object and a User object. login() saves the user's ID in the session, using Django's
    session framework.

    When a user logs in, the user's ID and the backend that was used for authentication are saved in the 
    user's session. This allows the same authentication backend to fetch the user's details on a future request.

====================================
logout()
====================================
    logout(request) : To log out a user who has logged in via django.contrib.auth.login(), use
    django.contrib.auth.logout() within your view. It takes an HttpRequest object and has no return value.


    When you call logout(), the session data for the current request is cleaned out. All 
    existing data is removed. This is to prevent another person from using the same Web 
    browser to log in and have access to the previous user's session data.
