Framework:
	A Framework is a set of conceptual structure and guidelines, used to 
	build something useful.
	
	A framework may include predefined classes and functions that can be 
	used to process input, manage hardware devices, and interact with 
	system software.
	
	The purpose of the framework is to allow developers to focus on 
	building a unique feature for their Projects rather than writing 
    code from scratch.
